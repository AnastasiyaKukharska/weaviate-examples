# Harry Potter Question Answering using Haystack & Weaviate

A demo notebook showing how to use Weaviate as DocumentStore in [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro).

If you're using Google Colab, you need to run a Weaviate cluster in WCS. You can make an account and start a service for free [here](https://console.semi.technology/). You can open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/semi-technologies/weaviate-examples/blob/main/harrypotter-qa-haystack-weaviate/COLAB-HarryPotter-QA-Haystack-Weaviate.ipynb).

If you want to run this notebook on locally, you can use the Jupyter notebook, and use the commands to start up a Weaviate on your local machine. Before you start, make sure to install Haystack using the instructions on the website: https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/installation.
