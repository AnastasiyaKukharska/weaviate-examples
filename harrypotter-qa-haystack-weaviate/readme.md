# Harry Potter Question Answering using Haystack & Weaviate

A demo notebook showing how to use Weaviate as DocumentStore in [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro).

If you're using Google Colab, you need to run a Weaviate cluster in WCS. You can make an account and start a service for free [here](https://console.semi.technology/). You can open [COLAB-HarryPotter-QA-Haystack-Weaviate.ipynb](./COLAB-HarryPotter-QA-Haystack-Weaviate.ipynb) in Google Colab, or simply use [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MIEiqhNT2WbbYJvVLqVZIV3jwwOEKoxL/view?usp=sharing).

If you want to run this notebook on locally, you can use the Jupyter notebook, and use the commands to start up a Weaviate on your local machine. Before you start, make sure to install Haystack using the instructions on the website: https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/installation.
